*timeout & fast retransmit could work at the same time

One possible case:
window size is 64, the first packet in window is lost.

After 3 dup acks, fast retransmit works --> window size 1, threshold halved
after 2nd 3 dup acks, fast retransmit works --> window size 1, threshold halved (no way to send another retransmitted packet since the only window slot is occupied by last retransmitted packet)
